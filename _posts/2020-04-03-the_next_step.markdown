*Topic- Why did you decide to learn software development?*

First things first, my future goal is to become a full-time Game Developer. I want this software development course to be the first step that helps me break into the tech field in one way or another. However, as much as I want to be a Game Developer, I have to prioritize supporting myself on my own first and not need to rely on family should anything happen. This is why I feel that at least breaking into the tech industry will set me up for more success than struggling to get an entry level game development position that may not be able to support myself financially.

I wanted to learn software development over something like data science because I feel more proud when I can see the work I've done. I feel as if I've done more progress which turns into motivation which can be important in bigger projects.

Regardless of what happens, this is my next step.
